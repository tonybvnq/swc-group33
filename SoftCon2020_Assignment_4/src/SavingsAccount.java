    // Depositing money simply adds the sum of money deposited to the customer's
    // savings.


    // Withdrawing money removes the specified sum to the customer's savings. A
    // customer can not withdraw more than the amount of their savings. Withdrawing
    // money returns the amount of money withdrawn.


    // Paying with bank transfer is only allowed if the customer has enough savings to pay
    // the specified amount of money. However, the method subtracts the paid amount from
    // the customer's savings, but it does not return the amount of money paid.


    // Paying by credit cards is always allowed, regardless of the amount of money
    // available in the customer's savings. However, a customer can not pay more than the
    // amount allowed by its credit card for each transaction (e.g., 2000 CHF for a regular
    // credit card, as specified below).
